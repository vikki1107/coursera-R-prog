Q11 - In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?
names(data)

Q12 - Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?
data[1:2,]

Q13 - How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?
nrow(data)

Q14 - Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?
tail(data, 2)

Q15 - What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
data[47,]

Q16 - How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
sum(is.na(data$Ozone))

Q17 - What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.
mean(data$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)

Q18 - Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?
a<-subset(data, Ozone > 31 & Temp > 90)
mean(a$Solar.R, na.rm = TRUE)

Q19 - What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?
a <- subset(data, Month == 6)
mean(a$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)

Q20 - What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?
a <- subset(data, Month == 5)
max(a$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
